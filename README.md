# js-quiz-cli
This little CLI brings fun JS questions to command line to keep yourself sharp in work pauses. :)

It scrapes "javascript-questions" project from "lydiahallie". (https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions/blob/master/en-EN/README.md). So special thanks for continuously adding new questions.
